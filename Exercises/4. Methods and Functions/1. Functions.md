1) Create a module called `ArithmeticFunctions` that has functions for all the operations in exercise `2.1.1`
2) Create a function called `guessRandomNumber` that asks for 2 parameters `Max` and `Tries`. The function should pick a random number between 1-[Max] and ask the user to try to guess it. The user should only be able to try a max of `Tries` times and get a message saying "You ran out of tries" if they can't guess it.
    you can create the function and use it on the same file. No need to make it a module.
    
3) Create a function that asks a user for a `number` and then runs a countdown IN SECONDS from that number until 0.
    TIP: Google `python wait 1 second`
