##### A: What will the following code produce?
```python
a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a + a + a)
```

##### B: What's wrong with the following script?
```python
a = 1
_a = 2
_a2 = 3
2a = 4
```

Tip: There are certain naming rules you need to follow when creating variables.

##### C: Executing the code will throw an error. Can you explain why?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a == b)
print(b == c)
```

##### D: Fix the first line so that it outputs the sum of 1 and 2. Please do not change the last two lines. Only the first one.

```python
a = "1"
b = 2
print(a + b)
```
