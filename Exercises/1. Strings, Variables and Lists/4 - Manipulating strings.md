1) Ask the user for:
    1) A full world.
    2) A single letter.
    
    Then print `The word [word] has the letter [letter] on it` or `The word [word] does not have the letter [letter] on it`

2) Ask the user for a word and then print out that exact same word, but all in uppercase letters.

3) Ask the user for a word and print how many letters does that word have in a nice text message.

4) Ask the user for a Phrase and then check if the word `Dog` is anywhere inside of it.

5) Ask the user for a word, then split that word as a list where each item corresponds to a letter of that word, and then print the whole list (as a list, not as a word). See [link](https://kite.com/python/answers/how-to-split-a-word-into-a-list-of-letters-in-python)
