Watch `Python Statements -> While Loops in Python` before starting these exercises

1) Get a random number between 1 and 10 and then ask the user to guess the number:
    - The random number should be decided before asking the user.
    - The program should keep asking the user for numbers until the guess the correct one.
    - You should use a `while` loop to achieve this.
